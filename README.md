# Device-Characterization
This is a function approximation problem that is color transformation between printer device color space and CIE XYZ space.
The aim of the Device characterization is that device coordinates (typically cyan,magenta,yellow and black) are converted into device-independent CIE XYZ values.
CIE XYZ data were measured for the patches of an IT8.7-3CMYK charaterization chart.
Using linear regression and forest regression model, the XYZ values are predicted in this project.
